# 3308 Campaign 03 -- Learning Tree Classification

## Due Date: February 10, 2019 @ 2300

## Purpose
* Work with trees
* Basic introduction Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
You are going to build an application that learns from its user to identify and classify things. The example I did is classifying animals. You can do that as well, or you can think up your own application. I will first describe animal classification for people that don't want to come up with their own application.

I can classify animals by their characteristics (it is in the water, it doesn't have legs, it has gills, it is a fish). You can imagine representing these characteristics in a tree like structure where internal nodes are characteristics (furry, 2 legs, lives in water) and leaf nodes are animals (dog, human, fish). The easiest (and recommended) way is to have your classification tree be a binary tree. Thus, each characteristic can be answered as yes or no (i.e., each internal node has exactly two children). Your application will start with a very basic tree you hard code in. That initial tree will have one internal node (the root) and two children. The user will then try to identify an animal by answering queries from your application. If your application eventually settles on the correct animal, great, if not, it will inquire as to the differentiating trait between the animal being identified and the leaf it had settled on. NOTE: You must provide the information that I provide in my output in this circumstance (e.g., "I don't know any furry, not squeaky, bipedal animals that aren't a human."). This amounts to your position in the classification tree. It will then create a new internal node and new leaf node to represent that trait as well as the new animal. Below you will find a sample run for my program. You must also be capable of saving your tree to a file when the program exists and be capable of reloading the tree when it begins again. This enables your AI to keep learning across sessions.

You do not need to do animal classification. If you can think of a better idea, go for it. You must replicate the functionality described as shown in the output. As a bare minimum, you need a classification tree, you need to print out the position when adding a new node, and you need to save to and read from a file. The same grading criteria holds for non-animal and animal classification. If you have any questions, run ideas past me.

The binary tree will be implemented in a class called `LinkedBinaryTree<E>` which implements the interface `BinaryTree<E>`. To process traversing the nodes of the tree you will need to implement the following traversal methods:

* DepthFirst and its strategies:
    * PreOrder
    * PostOrder
    * InOrder
* BreadthFirst

Each of these traversals will be implemented in the `edu.isu.cs.cs3308.traversals` package. Each Traversal must extend the `AbstractTraversal` class and implement the methods (not defined in AbstractTraversal) defined in the `TreeTraversal` interface. The algorithms for the traversals are as follows (**Note:** n is the current node and L is the list representing the traversal):

## DepthFirstTraversal(tree)
```
function dfsTraverse
    traverseFrom(tree.root())
end function

function traverseFrom(node)
    subTreeTraverse(node)
end function

function subTreeTraverse(n)
    L = [] // create a new empty list
    if not tree.isEmpty() then
        subtree(n, L)
    end if
    return L
end function
```

### PreOrderStrategy(tree)
```
function subtree(n, L)
    L.add(n)
    command.execute(n) // if command is available
    if n.left != null then
        subtree(n.left, L)
    end if
    if n.right != null then
        subtree(n.left, L)
    end if
end function
```

### InOrderStrategy(tree)
```
function subtree(n, L)
    if n.left != null then
        subtree(n.left, L)
    end if
    L.add(n)
    command.execute(n)
    if n.right != null then
        subtree(n.right, L)
    end if
end function
```

### PostOrderStrategy(tree)
```
function subtree(n, L)
    if n.left != null then
        subtree(n.left, L)
    end if
    if n.right != null then
        subtree(n.right, L)
    end if
    L.add(n)
    command.execute(n)
end function
```

## BreadthFirstTraversal(tree)
```
function traverse
    traverseFrom(tree.root())
end function

function traverseFrom(node)
    Q = [node] // a new queue containing
    L = [] // a new empty list
    while not Q.isEmpty do
        node = Q.poll()
        L.add(node)
        if node.left != null then Q.offer(node.left) end if
        if node.right != null then Q.offer(node.right) end if
    end while
    return L
end function
```

Also note that I have provided you with the `EnumeratedSaveCommand` and `EnumerationCommand` classes both of which extend the `TraversalCommand` class. These are found in the `edu.isu.cs.cs3308.traversals.commands` package. Traversal commands are provided to a traversal through the `setCommand()` method. As the traversal processes the tree (visits each node) the command's `execute()` method should be called to execute it's functionality:

* EnumeratedSaveCommand -- Used as the command for a traversal which will write the contents of a visited node to a file.
* EnumerationCommand -- Sets the number for a given node, based on the order of traversal.

## Class Diagram
The following is a class diagram depicting this, you are only responsible for implementing the classes colored blue:

![Class Diagram](diagram.png)

## Assignment
1. You will need to create a class to manage the questioning and to build the tree. I have included a class called `ClassificationTree`, but you can rename it to whatever suits your needs given your choice in the classification type.
2. In the `ClassificationTree` class there is a field called `tree` which is of type `BinaryTree<Datum>`, do not remove this (though you may change the type as it suits you), as this is the tree backend for your code. You will need to build this tree in order to complete the program.
3. There are several save methods and a load method that are used to save and retrieve your tree from a file. I have implemented these methods, but they rely on you implementing the following components:
    * Your implementations of the preorder, inorder, postorder, and breadthfirst traversals.
5. See below for an example of the Input/Output file format for an example Console Output for a run of the program.

## Submission
When you have completed the assignment (all tests pass) or it is reaching midnight of the due date, make sure you have completed the following:
1. Committed all changes to your repo
2. Pushed your changes to GitHub
3. Tagged your repo as "COMPLETE"
4. Pushed the "COMPLETE" tag to GitHub
5. Submitted your repository URL to Moodle in the Mission 01 submission section.

## Grading (50 Points)
* 5 Points -- Animals that are in the tree are successfully found
* 5 Points -- An internal node and leaf node are correctly added when a new animal is encountered
* 3 Points -- The position in the tree is printed when a new node is to be inserted.
* 2 Points -- The interface is clean and presentable. I understand that readability may depend on user input, but SOME input should make it very readable.
* 5 Points -- The saving and loading from a text file works.

## Hints
1. Below is an example of writing to and from a file. Feel free to modify it to fit your needs. You don't need to use it if you have a favored way of accessign files.
2. There are efficient ways of doing things and inefficient ways. Having a good plan together before you start writing code. Also, I use both a queue and stack at various points in the code. Keep those tools in mind as you design a solution.
3. Note: If at any point you want to use a queue, stack, list, ..., you are allowed to use either your prior developed implementations or the ones provided by Java.

## Example of Input/Output File
The input/output file format is `[parent num]:[dataum num]:[l for left side of parent, r for right side of parent, root is always r][datum prompt]`
